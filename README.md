Dank Meme generation with image captioning model. Calhacks 2016

by @wyndwarrior

edited by noob (myself) to try and make it only generate alt-right memes as part of experimental new turing test

basically:
iff user cannot tell which memes are made by bot and which are not 
then bot passes turing test
else bot fails turing test

bot can then be used to train people to spot alt-right iconography and/or lingo
